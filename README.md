Browser for your ears

This program should ease people into reading news/information from the web.

The motivation

Reading information from a web page could be a hard (even dangerous) process (disabled people, bad web desing, lazy people, reckless drivers). 

What if you don't use your eyeballs but your ears isntead?

Is the world going to become better (and safe) place? 

Yes.
